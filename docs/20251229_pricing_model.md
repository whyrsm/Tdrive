# Pricing Model

## Overview

Our pricing strategy centers on **"Unlimited"** as the core value proposition. Unlike traditional cloud storage services that limit storage and charge for more, we leverage Telegram's infrastructure to offer truly unlimited storage for all users.

## Tiers

### Personal Free

**Target**: Individual users who want reliable, unlimited cloud storage.

**Features**:
- Unlimited storage (powered by Telegram)
- Unlimited files & folders
- Full file management (upload, download, organize)
- File preview (images, videos, documents)
- Drag & drop uploads
- Single user only — no sharing

**Value Proposition**: "Unlimited personal cloud storage, forever free."

**Value Proposition**: "Share & collaborate with the people you trust."

## Conversion Strategy

### Primary Hook: Sharing

Sharing is the natural upgrade trigger. Free users have full access to all storage and organization features, but sharing is gated.

**Implementation**:
- "Share" button visible in UI for all users
- Free users clicking "Share" see an upgrade prompt
- Messaging: "Upgrade to Plus to share files and folders with others"

### Why This Works

1. **No artificial friction** — Free tier is genuinely useful and unlimited
2. **Natural upgrade moment** — Users hit the gate when they have a real need
3. **Clear value exchange** — Plus unlocks collaboration, not just "more storage"

## Competitive Positioning

| Feature | Us (Free) | Google Drive (Free) | Dropbox (Free) |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Storage | Unlimited | 15 GB | 2 GB |
| File size limit | 2 GB* | 5 TB | 2 GB |
| Sharing | Plus only | Yes | Yes |

*Telegram's file size limit

**Our angle**: We're the only service offering unlimited free storage. The trade-off is sharing requires Plus — a fair exchange for power users.
